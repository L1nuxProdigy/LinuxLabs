## Run the registry image
docker container run -d -p 5000:5000 --name registry registry

## Pull a simple image for testing and re-tag to push into the local docker registry
docker container run hello-world
docker image tag hello-world:latest <registry's FQDN or IP>:5000/hello-world
docker push <registry's FQDN or IP>:5000/hello-world

** for some reason specifying FQDN did not work

## Delete the image that was pushed and try to run/ pull it from the container registry
docker image rm hello-world
docker iamge rm <registry's FQDN or IP>:5000/hello-world
docker run 127.0.0.1:5000/hello-world

## Re-Create the registry using a bind mount and see how the data is stored
docker container run -d -p 5000:5000 --name registry -v $(pwd)/registry-data:/var/lib/registry registry
tree $(pwd)/registry-data

## Re-Upload an image to the new created registry, delete the registry again and recreate it and see if the pushed image can be pulled- was it stored in the volume
docker rm -f $(docker ps -a -q)
docker rmi -f $(docker images -a -q)
