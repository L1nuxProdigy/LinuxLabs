Linux:

    Set up an NGINX Reverse Proxy with the following sites:
        - Test.com – Reverse proxy to https://ynet.co.il with a self signed server cert
		
        - Test-client.com – Reverse proxy to https://ynet.co.il with a self signed server cert and client cert inforcment;
          that means I cannot access the url without adding the client-cert to the browser.
		  
        - Test-docker.com – Reverse proxy to a local mattermost container , also with client cert.
